Abstract in Motion: A Generative Mandala
Technologies Used
  Processing (Java-based framework)
  Perlin Noise
  Geometric Transformations (Rotation, Scaling)
  HSB Color Mode
Features
  Dynamic and hypnotic generative mandala animation
  Smooth, organic motion using Perlin noise
  Radial symmetry achieved by rotating the canvas 16 times
  Layered spiral structures with continuous color transitions
  Real time animation (60 FPS) using pushMatrix() / popMatrix()
Setup
  Processing
Usage
-int numLayers = 16;   // Number of symmetry divisions
-float noiseSpeed = 0.01;  // Speed of color and motion changes
  Adjusting these values changes the rhythm and density of the mandala
  Experiment with Perlin noise and color settings to generate your own abstract visuals
Project Status
  This project was created as part of a university coding prototype assignment
  Code, reflection, and video presentation have been completed
Future Enhancements: 
  Introduce random variations for unique patterns 
To do:
  Define targets – Decide which elements should vary (color, size, shape, position, timing
  Control consistency – Keep randomness within design rules to maintain visual balance
  Test and adjust – Run multiple tests, tune ranges for natural diversity
