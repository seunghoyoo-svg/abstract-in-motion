Abstract in Motion: A Generative Mandala

Technologies Used

    1. Processing (Java-based framework)
  
    2. Perlin Noise
  
    3. Geometric Transformations (Rotation, Scaling)
  
    4. HSB Color Mode
  
Features

    1. Dynamic and hypnotic generative mandala animation
    
    2. Smooth, organic motion using Perlin noise
    
    3. Radial symmetry achieved by rotating the canvas 16 times
    
    4. Layered spiral structures with continuous color transitions
    
    5. Real time animation (60 FPS) using pushMatrix() / popMatrix()


Setup
    
    Processing


Usage

    -int numLayers = 16;   // Number of symmetry divisions
    -float noiseSpeed = 0.01;  // Speed of color and motion changes
  
      Adjusting these values changes the rhythm and density of the mandala
  
      Experiment with Perlin noise and color settings to generate your own abstract visuals


Project Status
      
      1. This project was created as part of a university coding prototype assignment
      2. Code, reflection, and video presentation have been completed


Future Enhancements: 
          
          Introduce random variations for unique patterns 


To do:
      
      1. Define targets – Decide which elements should vary (color, size, shape, position, timing
      2. Control consistency – Keep randomness within design rules to maintain visual balance
      3. Test and adjust – Run multiple tests, tune ranges for natural diversity
